App is intended to replace manual mealplanning and make adjusting your mealplan midweek easy. Inspired by Google calendar and many other meal planning apps, the intention is to provide a simple interface without too many features, and to allow for quick access and adjustment of a week-long mealplan. 

## Overview

This app contains two basic functions: a shopping list and a calendar-like meal plan. The meal plan can be displayed in two ways: either by day with a list of meals for that day, or by week with all meals and events for that week displayed. 

### Day Planner View

- The day planner displays a date picker at the top of the view for switching between dates.
- Adjustment of event time/order can be acheived through drag and drop.
- Events can be removed by iOS slide to delete gesture or via the edit button. 
- Events of any type may be added to the currently displayed day.

### Week Planner View

- Date may be scrolled vertically, and events within a particular date may be scrolled horizontally
- Events may be re-ordered by dragging and dropping, and may be moved to other days of the week by way of a double tap
- Events of any type may be added directly a day by hitting the (+) button at the right-most of any day

### The Shopping List

- Foods/Shopping Items are attached to Meals and the shopping list will be generated based on which meals are added to the planner views
- The list is designed to be used while food shopping and allows users to check off items as they are  purchased
- To aid in this, the shopping list may be configured to only show unchecked items
- Custom items may be added to the shopping list which are not associated with a Meal
