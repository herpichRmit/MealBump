App is intended to replace manual mealplanning and make adjusting your mealplan midweek easy by being able to drag and drop meals and events around. Inspired by Google calendar and many other meal planning apps, the idea is to provide a simple interface without too many features, to allow for quick access and adjustment of a week-long mealplan. 

## Overview

This app contains two basic functions: a shopping list and a calendar-like meal plan. The meal plan can be displayed in two ways: either by day with a list of meals for that day, or by week with all meals and events for that week displayed. 

The Meal Planner
- Day Meal Planner View
    > The day planner displays a date picker at the top of the view for switching between dates.
    > Adjustment of event time/order can be acheived through drag and drop.
    > Events can be removed by iOS slide to delete gesture or via the edit button. 
    > Events of any type may be added to the currently displayed day.
- Week Planner View
    > Date may be scrolled vertically, and events within a particular date may be scrolled horizontally
    > Events may be re-ordered by dragging and dropping, and may be moved to other days of the week by way of a double tap
    > Events of any type may be added directly a day by hitting the (+) button at the right-most of any day

- Shopping List View
    > Foods/Shopping Items are attached to Meals and the shopping list will be generated based on which meals are added to the planner views
    > The list is designed to be used while food shopping and allows users to check off items as they are  purchased
    > To aid in this, the shopping list may be configured to only show unchecked items
    > Custom items may be added to the shopping list which are not associated with a Meal
